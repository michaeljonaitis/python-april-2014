# Comments can be created using the '#' character at the beginning of a line
# Single line comments are the most commonly used and preferred method of
# commenting.  If you're comment needs more than a single line to explain you
# should consider refactoring your code to make it more readable and easier
# to understand.

  Triple " can also be used to generate blocks of comments.  This is also used
  by Python's built-in documentation generator.  We'll talk more about this
  at another time.

  Notice I am able to type single and double quote characters without special
  considerations while within the triple quote comment block.

  Also notice I am not writing any lines to be longer than 79 characters.  This
  is because the PEP8 standard requires all lines be less than 79 characters.
  There are a handful of reasons to break this rule.  We'll be discussing PEP8
  throughout the course.
